🔐 Built a Multi-Agent AI-Powered SecOps Analysis Engine

I’ve been working on a personal project called SecOps AI Commander, where I designed and implemented a multi-agent security operations analysis system using Python, FastAPI, and DSPy.

🔹 What the system does:

Analyzes raw security logs using an AI-powered Log Analyzer agent

Detects threats, severity levels, and intrusion patterns

Correlates findings with the MITRE ATT&CK framework

Reconstructs likely attack chains and tactics

Generates actionable mitigation and response workflows

Orchestrates all agents through a centralized decision layer

🔹 Architecture highlights:

Modular, agent-based design (Log Analysis, Threat Intelligence, Orchestration)

DSPy-based structured reasoning (no free-form LLM outputs)

MITRE ATT&CK mapping with live API + fallback datasets

SOAR-style synthesis and prioritization logic

Exposed as a production-ready FastAPI service

This project helped me deepen my understanding of:

SOC workflows

Detection engineering

Threat intelligence correlation

AI-assisted security operations

API-first security tooling

Next steps include adding persistence, event correlation, and streaming ingestion.

Always open to feedback or discussions around SecOps, Detection Engineering, and AI in cybersecurity 🚀
