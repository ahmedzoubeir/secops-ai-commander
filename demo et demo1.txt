Both demo.py and demo1.py serve as interactive demonstrations of SecOps AI Commander, a multi-agent cybersecurity platform designed to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats in real time. The system orchestrates several specialized AI agents—LogAnalyzer, CVEScanner, ThreatIntel, NetworkScanner, and IncidentResponder—which work together to process incoming logs, scan networks, and consult threat intelligence sources such as MITRE ATT&CK (835 techniques, 187 threat groups) and CVE/NVD for vulnerabilities.

When the demos run, the Orchestrator agent initializes all sub-agents, connects to Redis for caching and messaging, and persists analysis results to a MySQL database. In demo.py, the focus is on real-time analysis of individual security events such as SSH brute-force attempts, ransomware alerts, and network scans. Each log entry is processed by the LogAnalyzer, which evaluates severity, categorizes threat types, and triggers downstream agents. The CVE Scanner assesses software versions against CVE/NVD databases, the ThreatIntel agent enriches events with MITRE ATT&CK mappings and external intelligence, and the NetworkScanner uses Nmap to discover open ports and exposed services. Finally, the IncidentResponder agent generates actionable containment and mitigation recommendations.

In demo1.py, the system demonstrates multi-stage attacks, simulating sequences of related malicious actions—such as repeated SSH login attempts leading to a compromise, lateral movement, or ransomware deployment. This version emphasizes the platform’s ability to track attack chains over time, correlate events across agents, and provide an end-to-end view of threats, including recommended actions and MITRE ATT&CK techniques involved. Both demos leverage DSPy and Groq LLM for AI-powered analysis, ensuring fast, intelligent decision-making. All results are stored in the MySQL database, while Redis caching and agent orchestration guarantee responsiveness during complex, multi-agent operations.

In short, the demos showcase a fully coordinated AI-driven cybersecurity workflow: ingest logs → analyze threats → enrich with intelligence → scan for vulnerabilities and network risks → map to MITRE techniques → generate incident response guidance → store results for historical reporting.
