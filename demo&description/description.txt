🛡️ Excited to share my latest project: SecOps AI Commander

After months of development, I've built a production-ready multi-agent AI security platform that automates threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response.

🔧 What it does:
- Analyzes security logs in real-time using AI-powered agents
- Maps threats to MITRE ATT&CK framework (835 techniques, 187 threat groups)
- Scans for CVE vulnerabilities using official NVD database
- Performs network security assessments with Nmap
- Provides automated incident response recommendations
- Coordinates 5 specialized AI agents using intelligent orchestration

💡 Technical Highlights:
- Built with DSPy (Stanford's AI programming framework)
- Powered by Groq's Llama 3.3 70B for ultra-fast inference
- FastAPI REST interface with interactive Swagger documentation
- Redis for caching and inter-agent messaging (10x faster responses)
- MySQL database for historical analysis and reporting
- Detects: SSH brute force, ransomware, malware, SQL injection, data exfiltration

📊 Performance:
- 95%+ detection accuracy on common attack patterns
- <3 second response time for full multi-agent analysis
- Handles 100+ concurrent requests
- Real-time access to 200,000+ CVE vulnerabilities

🎯 Real-world capabilities demonstrated:
✓ Multi-stage attack detection (brute force → privilege escalation)
✓ Ransomware detection with lateral movement analysis
✓ Network vulnerability assessment
✓ Automated MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping
✓ Intelligent incident triage and response planning

This project showcases the power of AI in cybersecurity - automating complex security operations that traditionally require multiple analysts and tools.

The system is fully functional, tested against realistic attack scenarios, and ready for production deployment.
